# algo-steps

This file is meant to solve to following problem:

Find the minimum number of steps it takes to reach the number n when starting from zero. The Ô¨Årst and last steps must be of length one. All steps are subject to the following restriction: The length of a step must be either (i) equal to the length of the previous step, (ii) one less than the length of the previous step, or (iii) one greater than the length of the previous step.

For example, if n = 3, then the minimum number of steps is 3, achieved by taking three steps of length one. If n = 4, then the minimum number of steps is also 3, found by taking a step of length 1, a step of length 2, and then a final step of length 1.
